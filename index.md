# Aberystwyth Python Study Group

## What is the Python Study Group
A group for anyone at Aberystwyth who uses (or needs/wants to use) the Python programming language in their research. The group aims to offer peer support to help explore the many useful features of Python and go beyond the basics.

## When/where does the group next meet?
None planned right now.

## How does it work?
At each meeting we'll pick a different topic and discuss it or get somebody more knowledgable to talk about it. See the [plan](plan) for a list of sessions currently planned. 

## Do I need to be a Python expert to attend?
No, this is intended for anyone with at least basic knowledge of Python. Those with more advanced knowledge are invited to attend and share what they know with the group. 

## I don't know any Python but would like to learn some
Python workshops run periodically, please check [SCW courses page](http://tinyurl.com/) for updates. Python learning materials are on the [notes](notes) page.

## I need help with a specific problem in my Python code.
This is best answered at [Hacky Hour](http://tinyurl.com/HackyHourAber) instead of the study group. Hacky Hour runs on alternate weeks to the study group and is intended for getting help with any research computing related problems, including Python programming.

## Do you have notes from previous sessions.
Yes, see the [notes](notes) page.

## Where can I get announcements of upcoming sessions?
Upcoming sessions will be announced on the Hacky Hour mailing list, [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/HackyHourAber) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HackyHourAber) pages.
