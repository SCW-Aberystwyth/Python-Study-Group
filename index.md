# Aberystwyth Python Study Group

## What is the Python Study Group
A group for anyone at Aberystwyth who uses (or needs/wants to use) the Python programming language in their research. The group aims to offer peer support to help explore the many useful features of Python and go beyond the basics.

## When/where does the group meet?
* On Thursday January 31st we're meeting at 3:10 pm in the [G24 computer room](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/timetable/zones/penglais/cledwyn/g24/).
* After this we'll meet every other Friday at 3:10pm in the [C66 computer room](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/timetable/zones/penglais/hugh-owen/c66/) in the Hugh Owen building.
* The dates for the rest of the 2019 Lent term are Fridays February 15th, March 1st, March 15th and March 29th.

## How does it work?
At each meeting we'll pick a different topic and discuss it or get somebody more knowledgable to talk about it. See the [plan](plan) for a list of sessions currently planned. 

## Do I need to be a Python expert to attend?
No, this is intended for anyone with at least basic knowledge of Python. Those with more advanced knowledge are invited to attend and share what they know with the group. 

## I don't know any Python but would like to learn some
There is a Python workshop on [February 6th and 13th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-plotting-with-python-tickets-53543320513). The study group is aimed at people who know at least what was covered by this course.

## I need help with a specific problem in my Python code.
This is best answered at [Hacky Hour](http://tinyurl.com/HackyHourAber) instead of the study group. Hacky Hour runs on alternate weeks to the study group and is intended for getting help with any research computing related problems, including Python programming.
