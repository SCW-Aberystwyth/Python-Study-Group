# Aberystwyth Python Study Group

## What is the Python Study Group
A group for anyone at Aberystwyth who uses (or needs/wants to use) the Python programming language in their research. The group aims to offer peer support to help explore the many useful features of Python and go beyond the basics.

## When/where does the group meet?
* First meeting: Friday January 18th 2019 in B20 Llandinam at 3pm.
* The plan is to meet at this time every other Friday.

## How does it work?
At each meeting we'll pick a different topic and discuss it or get somebody more knowledgable to talk about it.

## Do I need to be a Python expert to attend?
No, this is intended for anyone with at least basic knowledge of Python. Those with more advanced knowledge are invited to attend and share what they know with the group. 

## I don't know any Python but would like to learn some
There is a Python workshop on [February 6th and 13th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-plotting-with-python-tickets-53543320513). The study group is aimed at people who know at least what was covered by this course.

## I need help with a specific problem in my Python code.
This is best answered at [Hacky Hour](http://tinyurl.com/HackyHourAber) instead of the study group. Hacky Hour runs on alternate weeks to the study group and is intended for getting help with any research computing related problems, including Python programming.
